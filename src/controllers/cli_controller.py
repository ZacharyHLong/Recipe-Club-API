Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl. n a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.

Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce. Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)
