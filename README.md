# API

### **Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this partiular app.**  
  
I like to cook. Like, I like to cook a LOT. I also really like trying new recipes. I often find myself scouring the internet for recipes, only to be astounded by the endless possibilities and sheer magnitude of published recipes. After scouring the internet for the perfect recipe, I'll eventually give up and just select one at random.
  
Sometimes this random recipe is good other times it may suck, either way, the chances of me finding the recipe again are pretty slim. That's why I decided to design an API that allows you to save your favourite recipes online to a profile.  

The profile you create allows you to develop your own cookbooks, think of these like a song playlist in which others can follow a cookbook.

You can find other other users cookbooks and profiles to see what they've been cooking up. Follow any account that you click with to see their latest recipes and cookbooks.

At the root of this API is the desrire to do away with the long essays every single cooking blog feels the need to express. REWRITE THIS ALL
